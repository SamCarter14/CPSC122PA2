The graphs displaying time and total counts for bubble, insertion, and selection sort were usually proportional throughout. For example, when the vector sourting routines sorted vectors that were already sorted, bubble sort took the most time while insertion took the least. For the total count of sorted, insertion stayed at the bottom. Selection sort, however, had more total counts than bubble sort did even though it took less time. This shows that the graphs stayed fairly proportional to one another, as insertion stayed at the bottom and bubble and selection were close to each other. Another pattern that occured was the fact that insertion always remained at the bottom in terms of total count. While bubble and selection changed places, insertion always had the least amount of operations. Another thing to point out is that bubble sort always led in the amount of time it took to sort and led in 2/3 of the total operations performed. Overall, while graphs show several key points. They show that the insertion was always the lowest in the total counts, which could be the reason as to why it never took the most time. The bubble sort however, led the total count almost every time, and the one time it didn't it was right next to the selection total which had the most. This led to bubble leading in the amount of time it took to sort everytime. Overall, the amount of total operations were fairly proportional to the amount of time it took to sort.
